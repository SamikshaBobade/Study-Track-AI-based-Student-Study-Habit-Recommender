# Milestone 1: Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis

## 🎯 Objective
To preprocess and analyze student performance data by combining multiple tables and uncovering key learning patterns using data visualization and statistics.

---

## 📂 Dataset Source
- **Dataset Name:** Students Performance Dataset  
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Students Performance in Exams](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/students-performance-in-exams)
- **Tables Used:**
  - `students.csv` – contains student demographic and academic info.
  - `study_logs.csv` – contains daily study records and scores.
- **Common Key:** `student_id`

---

## ⚙️ Steps Followed
1. **Imported and joined** two datasets using `pandas.merge()`.
2. **Handled missing values** and **removed duplicates**.
3. **Encoded categorical variables** using one-hot encoding.
4. **Scaled numerical columns** for consistency.
5. **Generated summary statistics** and identified outliers.
6. **Performed EDA** with visualizations:
   - Score distribution
   - Study hours vs. performance
   - Gender-based score differences
   - Correlation heatmap

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib   

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Positive correlation between study hours and performance.
- Slight gender-based variation in score averages.
- Few outliers identified in study time and scores.
- Department-level performance trends observed.
